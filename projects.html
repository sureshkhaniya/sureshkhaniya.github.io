      <h3>Airlines Ticketing & Reservation System</h3>
      <p class="project-meta">
        Academic Desktop Application · C#, WPF (XAML), .NET, Microsoft Access (ADO.NET)
      </p>

      <p>
        This project is a desktop-based airline ticketing and reservation system
        designed to simulate real-world airline operations with a focus on aircraft
        configuration, seat allocation, and passenger management.
      </p>

      <p>
        The system allows users to manage flights, register passengers, and assign
        seats dynamically based on aircraft capacity. Business rules are enforced
        to prevent overbooking and to ensure that seat assignments remain consistent
        across all reservations.
      </p>

      <p>
        A relational database backend is used to persist passenger, flight, and
        reservation data. Data access responsibilities are separated from the user
        interface through dedicated service and manager classes, reinforcing clean
        architectural boundaries.
      </p>

      <p>
        The user interface was developed using WPF and XAML, emphasizing structured
        layouts, input validation, and event-driven interaction. This project
        highlights how desktop applications coordinate real-time user input with
        backend data storage.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Core Competencies:</strong>
        Object-Oriented Design, Desktop Application Development, Database Integration,
        Seat Allocation Logic, Event-Driven Programming
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Future Enhancements:</strong>
        Introduce pricing tiers by seat class, implement authentication roles
        (agent vs administrator), and migrate to a scalable SQL-based backend.

      <h3>Banking System Application</h3>
      <p class="project-meta">
        Academic Software Development Project · Java
      </p>

      <p>
        This project involved the design and implementation of a Java-based banking
        system that simulates core financial operations such as account creation,
        deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries.
      </p>

      <p>
        The application enforces strict business rules to ensure valid transactions
        and system consistency. Defensive programming techniques were applied to
        handle invalid inputs and prevent logical errors.
      </p>

      <p>
        A strong emphasis was placed on object-oriented principles, including
        encapsulation, responsibility separation, and maintainable class design.
        The system models realistic banking workflows while remaining extensible
        for future features.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Core Competencies:</strong>
        Business Logic Design, Input Validation, Defensive Programming
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Future Enhancements:</strong>
        Add persistent storage, authentication mechanisms, and concurrency controls
        to more closely resemble real-world banking systems.

      <h3>RV Park Management System (Team Project)</h3>
      <p class="project-meta">
        Team-Based Academic Project · Java, Web Technologies
      </p>

      <p>
        The RV Park Management System was developed as a collaborative team project
        focused on modeling operational workflows for a recreational vehicle park.
        The system manages reservations, customer records, and operational data
        using a modular software structure.
      </p>

      <p>
        This project emphasized teamwork, planning, and coordination within a
        shared codebase. Version control tools were used to manage contributions,
        resolve conflicts, and integrate independently developed components.
      </p>

      <p>
        The project reinforced real-world software development practices such as
        requirement analysis, task delegation, and incremental feature integration.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Core Competencies:</strong>
        Team Collaboration, Requirement Analysis, Modular Design, Version Control
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Future Enhancements:</strong>
        Add role-based access control, reporting tools, and improved user interface
        workflows for administrative users.

      <h3>Word Association Learning Activity</h3>
      <p class="project-meta">
        Upper-Division Academic Application · Node.js, Express.js, EJS
      </p>

      <p>
        The Word Association Learning Activity is an iterative Node.js application
        developed across multiple modules to reinforce user interface design,
        server-side routing, and application structure using Express and EJS.
      </p>

      <p>
        The application includes a user registration workflow where users submit
        personal and demographic information through dynamically rendered EJS forms.
        Additional user fields were identified through documentation review and
        integrated using appropriate form controls.
      </p>

      <p>
        Express routers handle both GET and POST requests, and browser developer
        tools were used to inspect network traffic and verify correct form
        submission behavior. The application also introduces role-based workflows
        by separating administrative views from standard user interactions.
      </p>

      <p>
        While the current implementation uses simulated data, the architecture is
        intentionally designed to support database integration in later modules.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Core Competencies:</strong>
        Express Routing (GET/POST), EJS Templating, Form Handling, UI Design,
        Role-Based Application Structure
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Future Enhancements:</strong>
        Integrate persistent storage, implement real statistical queries, and expand
        authentication and authorization features.

      <h3>Database Design and Implementation Project</h3>
      <p class="project-meta">
        Academic Database Project · SQL, Relational Databases
      </p>

      <p>
        This project focused on the design and implementation of a relational
        database system, including schema creation, table relationships, and data
        normalization to ensure integrity and consistency.
      </p>

      <p>
        SQL queries were written to retrieve, manipulate, and analyze data while
        enforcing referential integrity constraints. The project highlights how
        database design decisions directly impact application behavior and
        performance.
      </p>

      <p>
