    <h2>Academic & Development Projects</h2>
    <p>
      The projects below represent a progression of academic and practical software
      development work completed across multiple computer science courses. Together,
      they demonstrate applied knowledge of programming fundamentals, object-oriented
      design, database systems, user interface development, and collaborative engineering
      practices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each project emphasizes not only functional correctness, but also structure,
      maintainability, and alignment with real-world software design principles.
