<h1>Academic & Development Projects</h1>

<p>
    The projects listed below represent a progression of academic and practical
    software development work completed across multiple computer science courses.
    Together, they demonstrate applied knowledge of programming fundamentals,
    object-oriented design, database systems, user interface development, and
    collaborative engineering practices.
</p>

<p>
    Each project emphasizes not only functional correctness, but also structure,
    maintainability, and alignment with real-world software design principles.

<h2>Airlines Ticketing & Reservation System</h2>
<p><strong>Project Type:</strong> Academic Desktop Application</p>
<p><strong>Technical Stack:</strong> C#, WPF (XAML), .NET, Microsoft Access (ADO.NET)</p>

<p>
    This project is a desktop-based airline ticketing and reservation system
    designed to simulate real-world airline operations with a focus on aircraft
    configuration, seat allocation, and passenger management.
</p>

<p>
    The system allows users to manage flights, register passengers, and assign
    seats dynamically based on aircraft capacity. Business rules are enforced to
    prevent overbooking and to ensure that seat assignments remain consistent
    across all reservations.
</p>

<p>
    A relational database backend is used to persist passenger, flight, and
    reservation data. Data access responsibilities are separated from the user
    interface through dedicated service and manager classes, reinforcing clean
    architectural boundaries.
</p>

<p>
    The user interface was developed using WPF and XAML, emphasizing structured
    layouts, input validation, and event-driven interaction. This project
    highlights how desktop applications coordinate real-time user input with
    backend data storage.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Core Competencies:</strong>
    Object-Oriented Design, Desktop Application Development, Database Integration,
    Seat Allocation Logic, Event-Driven Programming
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Future Enhancements:</strong>
    Introduce pricing tiers by seat class, implement authentication roles
    (agent vs administrator), and migrate to a scalable SQL-based backend.

<h2>Banking System Application</h2>
<p><strong>Project Type:</strong> Academic Software Development Project</p>
<p><strong>Technical Stack:</strong> Java</p>

<p>
    This project involved the design and implementation of a Java-based banking
    system that simulates core financial operations such as account creation,
    deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries.
</p>

<p>
    The application enforces strict business rules to ensure valid transactions
    and system consistency. Defensive programming techniques were applied to
    handle invalid inputs and prevent logical errors.
</p>

<p>
    A strong emphasis was placed on object-oriented principles, including
    encapsulation, responsibility separation, and maintainable class design.
    The system models realistic banking workflows while remaining extensible
    for future features.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Core Competencies:</strong>
    Business Logic Design, Input Validation,
    Defensive Programming
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Future Enhancements:</strong>
    Add persistent storage, authentication mechanisms, and concurrency controls
    to more closely resemble real-world banking systems.
</p>

<h2>RV Park Management System (Team Project)</h2>
<p><strong>Project Type:</strong> Team-Based Academic Project</p>
<p><strong>Technical Stack:</strong> Java, Web Technologies</p>

<p>
    The RV Park Management System was developed as a collaborative team project
    focused on modeling operational workflows for a recreational vehicle park.
    The system manages reservations, customer records, and operational data
    using a modular software structure.
</p>

<p>
    This project emphasized teamwork, planning, and coordination within a shared
    codebase. Version control tools were used to manage contributions, resolve
    conflicts, and integrate independently developed components.
</p>

<p>
    The project reinforced real-world software development practices such as
    requirement analysis, task delegation, and incremental feature integration.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Core Competencies:</strong>
    Team Collaboration, Requirement Analysis, Modular Design, Version Control
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Future Enhancements:</strong>
    Add role-based access control, reporting tools, and improved user interface
    workflows for administrative users.

<h2>Word Association Learning Activity (Node.js / Express / EJS)</h2>
<p><strong>Project Type:</strong> Upper-Division Academic Application (Multi-Module)</p>
<p><strong>Technical Stack:</strong> Node.js, Express.js, EJS, JavaScript, HTML/CSS</p>

<p>
    The Word Association Learning Activity is an iterative Node.js application
    developed across multiple modules to reinforce user interface design,
    server-side routing, and application structure using Express and EJS.
</p>

<p>
    The application includes a user registration workflow where users submit
    personal and demographic information through dynamically rendered EJS forms.
    Additional user fields were identified through documentation review and
    integrated using appropriate form controls.
</p>

<p>
    Express routers handle both GET and POST requests, and browser developer
    tools were used to inspect network traffic and verify correct form submission
    behavior. The application also introduces role-based workflows by separating
    administrative views from standard user interactions.
</p>

<p>
    While the current implementation uses simulated data, the architecture is
    intentionally designed to support database integration in later modules.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Core Competencies:</strong>
    Express Routing (GET/POST), EJS Templating, Form Handling, UI Design,
    Role-Based Application Structure
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Future Enhancements:</strong>
    Integrate persistent storage, implement real statistical queries, and expand
    authentication and authorization features.

<h2>Database Design and Implementation Project</h2>
<p><strong>Project Type:</strong> Academic Database Project</p>
<p><strong>Technical Stack:</strong> SQL, Relational Databases</p>

<p>
    This project focused on the design and implementation of a relational
    database system, including schema creation, table relationships, and data
    normalization to ensure integrity and consistency.
</p>

<p>
    SQL queries were written to retrieve, manipulate, and analyze data while
    enforcing referential integrity constraints. The project highlights how
    database design decisions directly impact application behavior and
    performance.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Core Competencies:</strong>
    Relational Database Design, SQL Query Development, Normalization,
    Data Integrity
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Future Enhancements:</strong>
    Integrate the database with an application layer and apply indexing and
    optimization strategies for larger datasets.
