<h1>Academic & Development Projects</h1>

<p>
    The projects below represent a combination of individual coursework and
    structured team-based development. Each project demonstrates applied
    computer science concepts including software design, user interface
    development, backend routing, database fundamentals, and collaborative
    engineering practices.

<h2>Banking System Application</h2>
<p><strong>Project Type:</strong> Academic Software Development Project</p>
<p><strong>Technical Stack:</strong> Java</p>

<p>
    This project involved designing and implementing a Java-based banking
    system that simulates core financial operations such as account creation,
    deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries. The application enforces
    strict business rules to ensure valid transactions and system consistency.
</p>

<p>
    The primary focus of the project was object-oriented design. Classes were
    structured to encapsulate account data and behaviors, emphasizing clear
    responsibility separation and maintainable code structure. Defensive
    programming techniques were used to handle invalid inputs and prevent
    logical errors.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Core Competencies:</strong>
    Object-Oriented Programming, Business Logic Design, Input Validation,
    Defensive Programming
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Future Enhancements:</strong>
    Introduce persistent storage, authentication, and concurrency controls to
    more closely model real-world banking systems.

<h2>RV Park Management System (Team Project)</h2>
<p><strong>Project Type:</strong> Team-Based Academic Project</p>
<p><strong>Technical Stack:</strong> Java / Web Technologies</p>

<p>
    The RV Park Management System was developed as a collaborative team project
    focused on modeling real-world operational workflows for an RV park. The
    system was designed to manage reservations, customer information, and
    operational records using a modular software structure.
</p>

<p>
    This project emphasized teamwork, planning, and coordination within a
    shared codebase. Version control was used to manage contributions, resolve
    conflicts, and integrate independently developed components into a cohesive
    application.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Core Competencies:</strong>
    Team Collaboration, Requirement Analysis, Modular Design, Version Control
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Future Enhancements:</strong>
    Add role-based access, reporting features, and improved user interface
    workflows to support administrative decision-making.

<h2>World Association Learning Activity (Node.js / Express / EJS)</h2>
<p><strong>Project Type:</strong> Upper-Division Academic Application (Multi-Module)</p>
<p><strong>Technical Stack:</strong> Node.js, Express.js, EJS, JavaScript, HTML/CSS</p>

<p>
    The World Association Learning Activity is an iterative Node.js application
    developed across multiple modules to reinforce user interface design,
    server-side routing, and application structure using Express and EJS.
    The project is intentionally built in stages and continues to evolve as
    additional functionality is introduced.
</p>

<p>
    The application includes a user registration workflow where users
    self-enter personal and demographic data through dynamically rendered EJS
    forms. Additional user fields were identified through documentation review
    and integrated using appropriate form controls, including text inputs and
    list boxes, ensuring proper data submission via POST requests.
</p>

<p>
    Express routers were implemented to handle both GET and POST operations.
    Browser developer tools were used to inspect network traffic and verify
    correct form submission behavior, ensuring all fields were transmitted
    accurately to the server.
</p>

<p>
    The project also introduces role-based application design by distinguishing
    between administrative users and regular users. Administrative functionality
    includes report selection and result pages that simulate median values and
    top-performing results for selected educational demographics using dummy
    data.
</p>

<p>
    While this module does not yet integrate a database, the application was
    architected to support future data persistence and querying in later
    modules.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Core Competencies:</strong>
    Express Routing (GET/POST), EJS Templating, Form Handling, UI Design,
    Role-Based Application Structure, Debugging with Developer Tools
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Future Enhancements:</strong>
    Integrate database persistence, implement real statistical queries, and
    expand authentication and authorization mechanisms.

<h2>Database Design and Implementation Project</h2>
<p><strong>Project Type:</strong> Academic Database Project</p>
<p><strong>Technical Stack:</strong> SQL, Relational Databases</p>

<p>
    This project focused on the design and implementation of a relational
    database system, including schema creation, table relationships, and data
    normalization. The goal was to ensure data integrity, consistency, and
    efficient query performance.
</p>

<p>
    The project involved writing SQL queries to retrieve, manipulate, and
    analyze data while enforcing constraints to maintain referential integrity.
    Emphasis was placed on understanding how application logic interacts with
    database design decisions.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Core Competencies:</strong>
    Relational Database Design, SQL Query Development, Normalization,
    Data Integrity
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Future Enhancements:</strong>
    Integrate the database with an application layer and apply indexing and
    optimization strategies for large datasets.
