Digital Portfolio — Suresh Khaniya
Engineering With Intent

This repository contains the source code for my professional digital portfolio. It is not merely a collection of coursework artifacts; it is a structured representation of how I approach software engineering — deliberately, methodically, and with long-term clarity in mind.

I do not build projects to satisfy requirements.
I build systems to understand structure, constraints, and scalability.

This live environment reflects the current production version of the site and demonstrates structured front-end architecture, modular organization, and intentional UI presentation.

Professional Summary

I am a Computer Science student focused on software engineering, systems automation, and full-stack development. My work emphasizes architectural clarity, disciplined documentation, and maintainable code.

I approach engineering with long-term thinking — prioritizing structure, separation of concerns, and reproducibility over superficial complexity.

Featured Work
Advanced Log Management System

A Bash-based automation tool implementing log rotation, compression, and structured archival practices. Demonstrates system-level scripting discipline and defensive error handling.

AlgoGauge (MERN Stack Application)

A full-stack educational platform for algorithm visualization built using React, Node.js, and MongoDB. Focused on modular architecture and environment-based configuration management.

Engineering Philosophy

Software should be:

Readable before clever

Secure before scalable

Structured before expanded

Documented before deployed

Good code runs.
Great systems endure.
