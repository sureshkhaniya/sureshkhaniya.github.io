## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains the source code for my professional digital portfolio. It is not merely a collection of coursework artifacts.  
It is a structured representation of how I approach software engineering — deliberately, methodically, and with long-term clarity in mind.

> I do not build projects to satisfy requirements.  
> I build systems to understand structure, constraints, and scalability.

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

Software should be:

- **Readable before clever**
- **Secure before scalable**
- **Structured before expanded**
- **Documented before deployed**

> Good code runs.  
> Great systems endure.
