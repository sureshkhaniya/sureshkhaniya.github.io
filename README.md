# Digital Portfolio — Suresh Khaniya

This repository contains the source code for my professional digital portfolio, developed as part of my upper-division Computer Science coursework. The portfolio is designed to present my academic projects, technical experience, and professional readiness in a clear, structured, and publicly accessible format.

Rather than focusing on visual embellishment, the emphasis of this portfolio is on **clarity of thought, technical substance, and intentional presentation**. Each section has been carefully written to provide meaningful context for the work displayed, ensuring that projects are not merely listed, but properly introduced and explained.

##  Purpose & Philosophy

The intent behind this portfolio is twofold:

1. **Academic Demonstration**  
   To document and communicate the skills, concepts, and methodologies developed through structured coursework, including software design, user interface development, backend routing, and database fundamentals.

2. **Professional Readiness**  
   To present my work in a manner consistent with industry expectations, emphasizing maintainability, correctness, and thoughtful system design over superficial aesthetics.

This portfolio reflects an understanding that effective software engineering is as much about **communication and structure** as it is about code.
